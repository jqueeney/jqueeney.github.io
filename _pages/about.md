<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://merl.com/), and a Research Affiliate at MIT in the [Aerospace Controls Laboratory](https://acl.mit.edu/). My research focuses on developing reliable, data-driven algorithms for decision making and control.

I received my PhD in systems engineering from Boston University, where I was advised by Yannis Paschalidis and Christos Cassandras. I also hold a MS in systems engineering from Boston University, and a BA in mathematics and mathematical economics from Colgate University.

## Research

I am interested in building autonomous, data-driven systems that will benefit society. In order to accomplish this long-term objective, we need data-driven methods for decision making and control that can be trusted to deliver reliable performance in complex real-world applications. My current research considers deep reinforcement learning as a framework for achieving this goal. In particular, I am interested in developing reliable deep reinforcement learning algorithms with performance guarantees related to robustness, safety, and generalization.
