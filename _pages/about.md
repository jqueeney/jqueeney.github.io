## Research

<p style="text-align: justify">
My long-term research objective is to build autonomous, data-driven systems that will benefit society, and I am interested in reinforcement learning as a framework for achieving this goal. In order to accomplish this, my research focuses on addressing barriers that prevent the deployment of deep reinforcement learning for decision making in complex real-world applications. In particular, I am interested in developing theoretically supported deep reinforcement learning algorithms with performance guarantees related to training stability, robustness, safety, and generalization.
